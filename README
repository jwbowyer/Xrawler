0.2

This is Xrawler version 0.2, a package for crawling the arXiv preprint repository.

At the moment it only contains a naive weighted keywords feature for extracting relevant papers from arXiv's daily RSS feeds --- saving the time it takes to look through each paper, and the number of RSS bookmarks on your browser.

Later versions are likely to include:
*More sophisticated (machine learning) methods to classify your search topics
*Tests against snarxiv (random arxiv paper generator) for crackpottery.
